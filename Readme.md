# Cellular Automata for Covid Modeling

> Goal: Creating a cellular automata for modeling Covid-19 spreading.  

### Project description:

- Gathering data on the spread of Covid-19, such as infection rates and mortality rates, to use as inputs for the model.
- Defining the rules that govern the behavior of the automata. This will include the probability of infection, the rate of transmission, and the probability of recovery.
- Implementing the model with Python.
- Visualizing the results of the simulation using a user-friendly interface, written with pygame library.


### Tools and technologies used:

- Python, Pygame, matplotlib

### Expected outcomes:

- A functional cellular automata model for simulating the spread of Covid-19.
- Visualizations of the simulation results to aid in understanding the spread of the virus.
- Insights into the effectiveness of different intervention strategies, such as social distancing and vaccination, in slowing the spread of Covid-19.
